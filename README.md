02_reaction_game.py is just slightly modified to work under Python3 and python3-gpiozero.


This repository contains the code needed for the advanced projects for use with Simon Monk's Raspberry Pi Electronics Starter Kit. This can be purchased by following the links on the product page found here: https://www.monkmakes.com/rpi_esk/

PDF files for the instructions of the assembly of these projects can be found here: www.raspberrypitutorials.yolasite.com/electronics-starter-kit.php

All code has been compiled by Henry Budden and is based upon some code written by Simon Monk for the main RPESK projects. 

To install the code from this repositiory on a Raspberry Pi (must be connected to the internet):

`git clone https://github.com/henrybudden/rpesk-advanced`

The original code for the starter kit can be installed on a Raspberry Pi with the following commands: 

`wget http://monkmakes.com/rpesk.sh`

`chmod +x rpesk.sh`

`./rpesk.sh`
